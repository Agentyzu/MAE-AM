# MAE-AM

This repository contains the official implementation of the **MAE-AM** system, as described in the paper **"MAE-AM: Query-driven Multi-Advertisement Embeddings and Auction Mechanism in LLM"**, submitted to **ICDE 2025**.

## Introduction

**MAE-AM** is a query-driven Multi-Advertisement Embedding and Auction Mechanism designed for Large Language Models (LLMs). The system introduces a **multi-advertisement auction mechanism** to:

1. Efficiently allocate the word-length budget for advertisements.
2. Seamlessly embed advertisement content into generated replies, preserving contextual coherence.

This system demonstrates its capability to balance query relevance and advertisement utility, making it a significant contribution to the field of intelligent advertisement systems powered by LLMs.

## Datasets

* **ADGEN**: is a Chinese advertising dataset generated by models utilizing web tags and advertising copy. This dataset focuses on advertising content generation and primarily includes three product categories: shirts, skirts, and pants. Each sample contains detailed content descriptions of the associated product.
* **ATVI**: is an English dataset comprising approximately 2,000 authentic business advertising scripts. It en compasses 26 different industries, including automotive, healthcare, and tourism, and others.
