        "ad_copy": "Seattle, like many large cities, is really a collection of neighborhoods -- small towns if you will -- that combine to give the appearance of one large urban center. But take the time to look a little closer and you'll discover each section of the city is distinct in character, with its own attractions and reasons to visit. If you seek Seattle's Scandinavian heritage, head for Ballard. If you want a little Asian flavor, the International District should be your destination. Spectacular views? Try Queen Anne, Capitol Hill, West Seattle, or Magnolia. Whatever you seek in leisure, recreation, entertainment, or dining, you'll be sure to find it in one of Seattle's neighborhoods."
